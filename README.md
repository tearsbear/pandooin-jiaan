## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Project Structure

All components used in this project are located in the `app/components` directory. This is where you will find reusable UI elements and other React components that are essential for building the pages.

## Utilities

- API Functions: The API functions that handle external or internal API requests are located in `app/utils/api.js`. This file contains functions for making HTTP requests and interacting with various APIs.
- Helper Functions: Utility and helper functions that are used throughout the project can be found in `app/utils/helper.js`. These functions are designed to assist with various common tasks, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.
